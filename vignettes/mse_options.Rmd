The `run_mse()` function, and its associated wrapper functions, rely on an "options" list object to customize behavior. A default "options" list object can be created with the `setup_mse_options()` function. Required options, and their default values, are described below:

---

`n_projection_years`: the number of years to project forward using the specified HCR. The total number of simulation years will be `n_projection_years+n_spinup_years`. _DEFAULT: 100_.

`n_spinup_years`: the number of years to run the operating model before applying the specified harvest control rule or estimation procedure. Must be a value between 0 and 64, but values <50 have not been thoroughly tested. _DEFAULT: 64_.

`recruitment_start_year`: the simulation year to begin using the projected recruitment timeseries or function. Must be a value between `n_spinup_years` and 64. _DEFAULT: 64_.

`run_estimation`: whether the estimation model should be run and reference points/recommended TACs calculated from population estimates. If FALSE, reference points and TACs (from the HCR) will be calculated using OM values of selectivity and recruitment. _DEFAULT: TRUE_.
