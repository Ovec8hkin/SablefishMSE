\arguments{
\item{h}{steepness (0.2 <= h <= 1.0)}

\item{sbpr}{spawning biomass per recruit at unfished conditions}

\item{R0s}{vector of unfished recruitments (one for each regime, max 2)}

\item{sigRs}{vector of recruitment variability (one for each regime, max 2)}

\item{nyears}{total number of years of recruitments to generate}

\item{regime_length}{vector of length of each regime}

\item{starting_regime}{regime to start with (0 = first regime, 1 = second regime)}

\item{seed}{random seed for reproducability}
}
\description{
Defines a two-regime recruitment function where each regime
is defined by a Beverton-Holt stock recruitment relationship 
with differeing levels of R0 or sigR.
